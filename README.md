## Background
This was my first take home interview challenge. I was given a single JSON file and told to make a website fro the data.

I was notgiven any design or coding guidence. They screnner did say that they prefered vanilla JS.

The compsny I was intervieiwng with was William and Sonomma.

I named the fake site "Bill & Napa", a play on William & Sonoma's name. I used the design language from their website at the time as the visual insperation.

I used vanilla JS but created a few "components" usinh the JS/HTML template API.
