### Description
This was a take-home interview project for a retail company. 

They only gave me a `data.json` file and **NO** mockup. They asked me to make a whole website out of the data file 
without any frameworks in vanilla JS.

I was offered the job, but I had already signed with another company. That said, I did have fun doing this project,
so I've kept it around.

### Running
- clone this repo
- cd to the root directory
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

### Build System
I originally built this using all native JS without a framework or bundle system. I eventually added Parcel and moved code to SCSS in part to learn how Parcel works.


### Test
- No tests have been written yet.
